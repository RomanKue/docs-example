I wish to run my app in UNITY. Here is the configuration I would like to start with:

name: *lower case app name, e.g. vehicle-visualizer*

## Application Components

 * [ ] **front-end** my app has a front-end (web application), please generate a stub from a template for me.
 * [ ] **back-end** my app has a back-end (e.g. REST service), please generate a stub from a template for me.


## The Way We Work Together

 * [ ] I accept the [terms of service](https://pages.atc-github.azure.cloud.bmw/UNITY/unity/Terms-of-Service.html).

*Note: checkboxes can be checked by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.*
