I wish to run my app in UNITY. Here is the configuration I would like to start with:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
name: <my-app-name>
displayName: Nice App Name
description: Here is the description for the app catalog, which will be displayed there. If you don't provide one, the one from Connect IT will be taken.
```

*The app's name should be URL compatible, so prefer `my-app` over ~~`MyApp`~~ or ~~`my app`~~.*

**Application Components**

 * [x] please generate a front-end [Angular](https://angular.io) stub from a template for me.
 * [x] please generate a back-end [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io) stub from a template for me.

**The Way We Work Together**

 * [ ] I accept the [terms of service](https://pages.atc-github.azure.cloud.bmw/UNITY/unity/Terms-of-Service.html).
