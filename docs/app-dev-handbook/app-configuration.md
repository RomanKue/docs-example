# App Configuration

Apps may need environment specific configuration, such as URLs to external systems or secret information like
client-ids.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables can be configured in the `unity-app.*.yaml` files.

```yaml
deployments:
  api:
    # ...
    container:
      env:
        FOO:
          value: some-value
        BAR:
          value: another-value
```

The values may be set specific to the environment.

Especially with [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io), environment variables can be used to set all
[Config Sources](https://quarkus.io/guides/config-reference#configuration-sources).
Other configuration mechanisms, like config files, are currently not supported.

## Secrets

To configure an app with secret information, values can be stored in encrypted form in the `unity-app.*.yaml` files.

```yaml
deployments:
  api:
    # ...
    container:
      secretEnv:
        PASSWORD:
          value: crypt.v1[atAkljasdjs/0==]
```

To encrypt a value, run the `encrypt` workflow in you repository:

![](../assets/actions-encrypt-workflow.png)

Specify the yaml path, e.g. `deployments.api.container.secretEnv.PASSWORD.value`, the secret value `psst` and the
environment.

![](../assets/run-encrypt-workflow.png)

The workflow will take the `CRYPT_MASTER_KEY`, stored in your repository, and encrypt the secret value.
Then a pull request will be created, which you can review, approve and merge afterwards.

![](../assets/approve-password-pr.png)

ðŸš¨ Never share the `CRYPT_MASTER_KEY` with anyone, this key can be used to decrypt all the secrets in your yaml file.

You can rename the environment variable afterwards.
Note, that encryption is environment specific as `CRYPT_MASTER_KEY`s are different, so you cannot copy the encrypted
value from `int` to `prod`. Instead, run the encrypt workflow for both environments.

When deploying an app, the `deploy-unity-app` action will validate that all secrets can be decrypted with the
current `CRYPT_MASTER_KEY`. If decryption fails, the app cannot be deployed.

## Headers and Cookies

You can also set custom headers or cookies to provide environment specific configuration for your app.
See [HTTP Headers](http-headers.html) for details.

When using cookies, keep in mind that these mey be shared on the entire domain `unity.bmwgroup.net`.
So it is recommended to use the following naming convention and config:

```yaml
deployments:
  ui:
    headers:
      response:
        add:
          Set-Cookie: app-foo-ui-environment=int; Secure; SameSite=Strict; Path=/foo/ui
```

The name of the cookie `app-foo-ui-environment` should have the following segments:

`app-<name>-<deployment>-<cookie-name>`

* `<name>` name of your app
* `<deployment>` name of the deployment (optional)
* `<cookie-name>` name of the cookie value

Setting `Path=/foo/ui` is also recommended.
Check [Set-Cookie on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie) for more details.
