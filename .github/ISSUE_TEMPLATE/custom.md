I wish to run my app in UNITY. Here is the configuration I would like to start with:

name: *lower case app name*

deployments:

 * [] **front-end**: my app has a front-end (web application), please generate a stub from a template for me.
 * [] **back-end**: my app has a back-end (e.g. REST service), please generate a stub from a template for me.

I accept the [terms of service]().
