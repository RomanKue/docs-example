# DevOps Handbook

The DevOps Handbook should help the UNITY team to understand the architecture, development and operation of the
platform. It is open source, though, so everybody may read it to get a deeper understanding of the platform.

## Table of Contents

* [Networking](networking.md) and DNS setup behind `https://unity.bmwgroup.net`
* [Kubernetes](kubernetes.md) objects managed to keep UNITY alive
* [Envoy](envoy.md) the sidecar for each app to get networking right
* [Certs](certs.md) for securing communication via TLS
* [Technical Accounts](technical-accounts.md) such as qq-users
* [Regular Activities](regular-activities.md) the last bits of manual work that cannot be automated
